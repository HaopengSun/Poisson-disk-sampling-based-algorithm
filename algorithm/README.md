# Poisson disk Sampling based algorithm to generate DEM models

The algorithm is able to generate DEM models which feature similarly with real soil in terms of
the particle size distribution and the void ratio.

the files whose names begin with _ are modules that can be used in all algorithms

2D-algorithm allows users to imput algorithm-demanded parameters using terminal
