The algorithm patent belongs to Concordia University.

I, Haopeng, would like to acknowledge the financial support from my supervisor, Dr Attila Michael Zsaki,
through the GCS FRS funds and from a Concordia SEED Individual research grant held by my supervisor to help
me successfully complete the research work.
