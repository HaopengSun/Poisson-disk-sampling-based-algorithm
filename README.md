# Poisson disk Sampling based algorithm to generate DEM models

The algorithm is able to generate DEM models which feature similarly with real soil in terms of
the particle size distribution and the void ratio.

## Poisson Disk Sampling algorithm

The process of point creation in this section is similar to the method proposed by Bridson (2007).
