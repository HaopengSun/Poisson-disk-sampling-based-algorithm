# Poisson disk Sampling based algorithm to generate DEM models

The algorithm is able to generate DEM models which feature similarly with real soil in terms of
the particle size distribution and the void ratio.

## Poisson Disk Sampling algorithm

The process of point creation in this section is similar to the method proposed by Bridson (2007).

## Voids infilling by Grid Sampling

## users can input parameters in the terminal to run the algorithm
run 2D-algorithm.py/3D-algorithm.py and input parameters based on instructions

## 2D model visualization

P5.js is introduced to realize DEM model visualization
